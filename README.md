# RestaurantSales_2Weeks
This one aims to merge the scattered datasets together in one new dataset with a little bit of my first time using Matplotlib.

We have dataset that some columns are represent the same thing so what I want to do is to merge all of it together in one dataset.
and then I want to find out which Food Item was sold the most in 2 weeks with the total incomes of each items.

Example of the scattered datasets used in this.

As can see above the "ID" and "Customer ID" both are representing the same thing.

Below is the Dataset after merging.
